## Talk Title

DeepDive into DevSecOps 

## Elevator Pitch (300 Characters)

DevSecOps is a misnomer. The idea that Security is smashed in between Dev and Ops is exactly the problem we face. In this talk, we will deep dive into a sample DevSecOps pipeline and show precisely how Security is not the blocker some make them out to be. 

## Description 

DevSecOps is a misnomer. The idea that Security is smashed in between Dev and Ops is exactly the problem we face. Many believe security is the blocker before getting their application out to production. Owned by some distant, unapproachable team, security can seem like the new deep divide with a 'throw it over the wall' mentality. 

Instead, Security must be sprinkled throughout the DevOps cycle, taught from the beginning when developing best practices, and owned by the entire team. In this talk, we will dive deep into a sample DevSecOps culture and pipeline and show precisely how Security is not the blocker some make them out to be but an enabler to a positive customer experience.  

We will focus on a fictional company, specific challenges they faced, and the things they did to address those challenges from Threat Modeling and Risk Classification, Security Education, Automated Policy Enforcement, Secrets Management, Vulnerability Scanning, SAST and DAST, monitoring, and more. 

We'll step through the DevOps cycle and expose exactly where Security comes into play and how many of the steps/process/requirements can be automated to eliminate toil. 

## Timing
Talk is a 30 - 45 minute session

##Notes 
* I'll use a powerpoint presentation.  
* Will need 2 mics - adding a co-presenter / security expert. 

## Speaker Experience
I’ve supported enterprise organizations on their DevOps journeys for the past 7 years and have made some awesome mistakes along the way. Whenever I ask someone what tangible items are considered “DevSecOps” they throw ‘tools and training’ at me with limited detail. This presentation is intended to provide the detail we’ve all been searching for. I don’t sell software. 

I’ve presented in at a variety of events including AWS re:Invent, CloudExpo and DevOps Summit, Microsoft Channel9, CA World, DockerNYC Meetup, and DeveloperWeek NY, and Developer Week Austin. I’ve also presented at a variety of local community organizations like Girls Inc., Girls Scouts of Nassau County, XXCoders, AlignUS, Ctrl+She, and others.
